The future of LegaLOne
===

Hi. My name is Andre Pena and on this video, I'm going to present what we envisioned as the future of LegalOne as a platform.
What I'm about to present is the result of years of meetings and discussions 
 
 What is LegalOne?
 ---
 
LegalOne is an Enterprise resource planning solution, or an ERP, that is focused on law firms and legal departments.
So, first, what is an ERP?
 
From Wikipedia, an ERP is:

... A business-management software, typically a suite of integrated applications, that an organization can use to collect, store, manage and 
interpret data from many business activities, including:

 - product planning, cost
 - manufacturing or service delivery
 - marketing and sales
 - inventory management
 - shipping and payment
 
Or you can just say an ERP is the software solution that a businesses use for managing most, if not all, of the data in 
their operations. That's why ERP systems are also called data-centric business applications. In the specific case of
LegalOne, we provide a variety of solutions for our customers like accounting, billing, time tracking, services management 
and time tracking and, most importantly, matter management.

Is LegalOne a product or a platform?

LegalOne started out as a product called Novajus, which was origninally aimed at law firms. However, because Novajus was a fast-growing product and it had a favorable architecture, we saw the potential to turn it into something bigger. We wanted to be able to leverage the core features, like the user interface, security, auditing, customizable reports and so forth, and allow for specific business rules to be customized, in such a way that Novajus could reach out new markets, like legal departments, or even new regions.
