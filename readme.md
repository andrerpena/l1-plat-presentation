#The future of LegaLOne#

Hi. My name is Andre Pena and on this video, I'm going to present what we envisioned as the future of LegalOne as a platform.
What I'm about to present is the result of years of meetings and discussions 
 
 ##What is LegalOne?##
 
LegalOne is an Enterprise resource planning solution, or an ERP, that is focused on law firms and legal departments.
So, first, what is an ERP?
 
From Wikipedia, an ERP is:

... A business-management software, typically a suite of integrated applications, that an organization can use to collect, store, manage and 
interpret data from many business activities, including:

 - product planning, cost
 - manufacturing or service delivery
 - marketing and sales
 - inventory management
 - shipping and payment
 
Or you can just say an ERP is the software solution that a businesses use for managing most, if not all, of the data in 
their operations. That's why ERP systems are also called data-centric business applications. In the specific case of
LegalOne, we provide a variety of solutions for our customers like accounting, billing, time tracking, services management 
and time tracking and, most importantly, matter management.
